        <div class="panel">
          <p>The standard Home Inspection is non-invasive visual examination, one of the benefits of hiring an inspector is we have tools and expertise to safely identify issues that may be hidden and like having a physical we will alert you if a specialist needs to be brought in. Some examples of limitations include:
          <div>
            <ul class="limitations-list">
              <li class="limitation">access unavailable or locked at the time of inspection</li>
              <li class="limitation">a roof covered with snow</li>
              <li class="limitation">outside temperature limiting the testing of HVAC appliances</li>
              <li class="limitation">opening walls</li>
              <li class="limitation">unsafe conditions</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
